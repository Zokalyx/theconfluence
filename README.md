# The Confluence Website

This repo contains code for arrivals and departures processing, the website and the bot.

## [Website](https://zokalyx.github.io/theconfluence/)

Features that may get added: 

- Making the search by user mobile-compatible

- Search by flair number and see all of the people who have had that flair (Not sure about this one. Is not very interesting, maybe only top 10 or so).

- Interactive and/or animated version of the Colorful Number Timecourse graph

- (If requested) "About" section where I explain technical details.

- Page for links to all of the posts about runs.

Suggestions are always welcome (u/Zokalyx)
